刚做完Splunk的OA。估计是我目前做过的最简单的OA了。和狗家的OA用的是一个平台。在网上直接写code的。一共2道题。共耗时40分钟。基本不需要准备，可以直接打开开始做。每道题估计不需要超过10line的code。有些怀疑这么水的OA是否会给interview。题如下:1. A non-empty array A consisting of N integers is given.
Array A represents a linked list. A list is constructed from this array as follows:
the first node(the head) is located at index 0;
the value of a node is -1 then it is the last node of the list;
if the value of a node is -1 then it is the last node of the list;
otherwise, the successor of a node located at index k is located at index A[K](you can assume that A[k] is a valid index, that is 1<=A[k]<N).
For example, for array A such that:
A[0] = 1
A[1] = 4
A[2] = -1
A[3] = 3
A[4] = 2
the following list is constructed:
the first node(the head) is located at index 0 and has a value of 1;
the seconde node is located at index 1 and has a value of 4;
the third node is located at index 4 and has a value of 2;
the fourth node is located at index 2 and has a value of -1.. check 1point3acres for more.
Wite a function: class Solution{public int solution(int[] A);}
That, given a non-empty array A consisting of N integers, returns the length of the list constructed from A in the above manner.


2. A non-empty array A consisting of N integers is given. The amplitude of this array is defined as the largest possible difference between two of its elements, ie:
amplitude(A) = max{A[P]-A[Q]: 0<= P,Q < N}

Write a function: class Solution {public int solution(int[] A); }

that, given a non-empty array A consisting of N integers, returns its amplitude.

For example, give array A such that:

A[0] = 10

A[1] = 2

A[2] = 44

A[3] = 15

A[4] = 39

A[5] = 20

The function should return 42.

Write an efficient algorithm.


我申请的是backend engineering intern。是10月在career fair上投递的简历。前几天才得到的通知。目前还不知道结果。他家的产品有很多企业在用。所以稍微用心做了一下人脉交流。希望能得到实习机会吧。
